<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project

<h3>Electric energy</h3>
<p>
  The energy generated by the movement of electrons from one point to another.
  <br />
</p>

<h3>Scatter plot</h3>
<p>
  A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent
  values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the
  horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point.
  Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables. <br />
</p>

<h3>Renewable energy</h3>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy produced from sources like the sun and wind that
  are naturally replenished and do not run out. Renewable energy can be used for
  electricity generation, space and water heating and cooling, and
  transportation. <br />
</p>

<h3>Watt(physical unit)</h3>
<p>
  The watt (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard
  unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second.
  The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy isdissipated,
  or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or
  dissipated. <br />

  The watt (symbol: W) is the unit of power or radiant flux in the International
  System of Units (SI), equal to 1 joule per second or 1 kg⋅m2⋅s−3.[1][2][3] It
  is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer. <br />
</p>

<h3>Linnear regresion</h3>
<p>
  What is linear regression? Linear regression analysis is used to predict the
  value of a variable based on the value of another variable. <br />

  The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. <br />

  The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the
  independent variable. <br />
  <br />

  The independent variable is also the predictor or explanatory variable that
  remains unchanged due to the change in other variables. <br />
